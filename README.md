# Data Science Practice Repository
This repository contains my practice exercises using Python for data science.

## Purpose
To build foundational skills in Python programming and data analysis through hands-on practice.

## Note
These are skill-building exercises, not full projects. Complete data science projects will be added as I develop the required skills.
